# Slice-by-Slice Summary (01–07)
Version: 0.1.1
Last Updated: 2026-01-06

| Slice | Focus | Key Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 01 – Pipeline Scaffold | Established deterministic repo structure, Python package layout, and initial governance. | `src/enterprise_synthetic_data_hub/` created with config/models/generation stubs, `mop/` updated, quickstart documented. |
| 02 – Schema Design | Authored authoritative Person, Vehicle, and dataset metadata schemas. | `schemas/v0.1/*.yaml`, Pydantic models under `src/enterprise_synthetic_data_hub/models/`, validator stubs referencing schema versions. |
| 03 – Generator v0.1 | Built deterministic generator that links Persons ↔ Vehicles and emits metadata. | `generation/generator.py`, dataset settings, manifest writer, initial `data/snapshots/v0.1/*`. |
| 04 – Validation Suite | Added critic prompts plus executable validators for schema, generator, CLI, and API. | `agentic/validators/*.py`, `agentic/critic/` templates, pytest coverage for schema/metadata checks. |
| 05 – CLI & Usage | Delivered governed CLI exports and manifest packaging. | `src/enterprise_synthetic_data_hub/cli/main.py`, README usage examples, CSV/JSON outputs under `data/snapshots/v0.1`. |
| 06 – API Alignment | Implemented Flask API to mirror governed schema and share generator output. | `src/enterprise_synthetic_data_hub/api/app.py`, `src/api/api_server.py`, `tests/api/test_demo_api.py`. |
| 07 – Demo Readiness | Hardened prompts, governance, and documentation for stakeholder demos. | This demo system (`docs/demo/**`), slide deck, talking points, and critic coverage to keep artifacts accurate. |

## Slice 08–14 Preview
| Slice | Focus | Key Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 08 – Generator Enhancements | Added derived Profile schema/model, builder helpers, and curated JSON samples under `data/demo_samples/v0.1/`. | `schemas/v0.1/profile_schema.yaml`, `models/profile.py`, `generation/profiles.py`, sample exports. |
| 09 – Flask API | Created governed Flask app with `/healthz`, `/generate/person|vehicle|profile|bundle` plus unit tests. | `src/enterprise_synthetic_data_hub/api/app.py`, `tests/api/test_demo_api.py`. |
| 10 – Demo CLI | Authored `scripts/demo_data.py` (Rich-based preview) + helper module, docs, and tests. | `src/enterprise_synthetic_data_hub/cli/demo.py`, `scripts/demo_data.py`, `tests/cli/*.py`. |
| 11 – make demo | Automated generator/API/CLI walkthrough via `Makefile` + `scripts/demo_start_api.sh`. | `Makefile`, automation script, README instructions. |
| 12 – Demo Runbook | Documented step-by-step instructions for running the live demo. | `docs/demo/06-runbook.md`, README cross-links. |
| 13 – Smoke Tests | Added pytest `smoke` and `demo` markers, API/CLI smoke coverage. | `tests/smoke/test_demo_flow.py`, `tests/cli/test_demo_cli_smoke.py`, `pyproject.toml` marker config. |
| 14 – Prompt Archive | Archived v1 prompts under `archive/demo_v1/` and created v2 MOP + slice prompts + changelog. | `archive/demo_v1/**`, updated `mop/` + `prompts/`, `docs/demo/changelog_v2.md`. |

## Highlights
- Each slice finished with an Analyze → Execute → Validate report captured in prompts/tasks, ensuring traceability.
- Governance artifacts codify pause-for-approval checkpoints so future scope expands safely.
- The snapshot manifest + CLI exports remained versioned (`v0.1`) throughout to guarantee reproducibility.

## Ongoing refinements
- Demo profiles (`config/demo.yaml`) keep record sizes, seeds, and API defaults consistent across CLI, API, and demo flow.
- The demo orchestrator (`scripts/run_demo_flow.py`) collects artifacts under `data/demo_runs/` for easy sharing.
