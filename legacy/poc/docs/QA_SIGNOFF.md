# QA Sign-off Log

## Status update — 2026-01-06
- No new QA sign-off has been recorded since the 2025-12-30 run below.
- Demo profiles and orchestration references were refreshed in docs only; no additional test execution is implied.

## QA Sign-off Summary — 2025-12-30 (Windows / Git Bash / Python 3.13.2)

### Environment
- OS: Windows + Git Bash
- Python: 3.13.2
- Branch: develop (clean working tree)
- Date: Dec 30, 2025

### PASS — Core health & deterministic behavior
- Settings load with deterministic defaults (dataset_version=v0.1, seed 20251101, marker enterprise-synthetic-data-hub v0.1)
- scripts/demo_validate.py passes: Person schema checks, Vehicle schema checks, Synthetic marker checks
- Test suite: pytest -m demo => 14 passed (includes golden determinism, API contract, negative-path)

### PASS — Live API manual verification
- Manual Flask start on 127.0.0.1:5000
- /healthz returns status ok + plan + seed
- /generate/profile returns deterministic JSON and includes synthetic_source marker
- Invalid request returns HTTP 400 with error envelope {"error":{"code":"invalid_request",...}}

### PASS — Snapshot artifacts generation
- Orchestrator Step 1 generated snapshot artifacts under scripts/data/demo_runs/<timestamp>_baseline/
- dataset JSON + metadata + manifest + README + CSVs present

### Known issues / follow-up
- Windows environments without bash should use `scripts/bootstrap_and_demo.ps1` or run `python scripts/run_demo_flow.py` directly; `make demo` depends on bash scripts.
- `python -m enterprise_synthetic_data_hub.cli.demo --help` prints nothing because the module is not a `__main__` entrypoint; use `scripts/demo_data.py` instead.
